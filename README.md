## Building Your own Hooks
* JS functions that have have word use in front of them. 
* Pass information between hooks
## Rules of Hooks
* Use only at the top level.
    * No loops, conditions, or nested functions.
* Only call Hooks from React Functions. 
    * Call Hooks from React Function Components
    * Call Hooks from custom Hooks.
## Custom Hook-all you need to know
* Hooks are just functions. 
* You can optimize performance by skipping useEffect with optional arguments.
## 10 Essential React Hooks
* This was a good read I like that you can just write a function via props then call it at the top level and boom! You've got yourself a function with useable state and it's only one source of truth. I also liked the firebase hook because I have a sneaking suspicion that I'll probably be using it for a future project.
